'''
Same Tree
Easy

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if p == None and q == None:
            return True
        if (p == None and q != None) or (p != None and q == None):
            return False
        if p.val == q.val:
            return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
        return False
